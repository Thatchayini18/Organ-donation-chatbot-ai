This project focuses on improving the efficiency of organ donation systems.

The system provides a unified platform where donors and recipients can register.

Machine learning algorithms are used to prioritize critical patients based on urgency.

Fake donor entries are detected using data validation and anomaly detection techniques.

Automated donor-recipient matching ensures compatibility and reduces delays.

Once a valid match is found, recipients are notified immediately via email.

The platform includes modules such as registration, matching, dashboard, and admin control.

The AI chatbot assists users by answering questions, guiding processes, and providing system clarity.
